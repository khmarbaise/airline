As of Airline 3.0.0 new variants of some Help related annotations allow for
help to be separated out into external resources.  This allows content like 
this to be more naturally managed rather than being shoe-horned into 
annotations.

An empty line denotes a new paragraph.  We can have as many paragraphs as we want.

This resource was referenced by a @ExternalProse annotation.  There are also 
@ExternalExitCodes, @ExternalExamples and @ExternalTabularExamples 
annotations which provide other help sections via external resources.

By default, external resources are located via the Classpath or the Filesystem but the
annotations allow for users to customise how the resources are located via Airline's
ResourceLocator abstraction.  In particular when using Airline on the Module Path, i.e.
a JPMS context, you may find it necessary to take an additional dependency on the
airline-jpms-resources module and explicitly configure the JpmsResourceLocator as an
additional locator.

External resources need to be parsed into suitable data for use with Airline's 
HelpSection system.  The default parser copes with simple text documents for 
prose like content e.g. this and tabular content formatted as CSV.  There is also
a TabDelimitedHelpParser that can be used if tabular content is formatted as TSV
instead.
